This block has 3 main components:
* Polyphse Filter Bank with 64 channels, 50 % overlap, x32 decimation.
* Channel selector to grab 4 channels from the PFB.
* Four phase-coherent DDSs with frequency/phase settings.

The 4 outputs are independent from each other. The same PFB channels can
be routed multiple times to individual outputs, and apply a different
DDS down-conversion frequency.
